\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	In this short report we show how arduino can be used to interface a guitar and a trackpad to a PC using the serial port. The interface is then used by a Java software which processes the audio and applying effects like distortion, reverb, and so on. Input data acquired by the trackpad is used to adjust how the effect is applied.
