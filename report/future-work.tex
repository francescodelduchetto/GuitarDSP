\chapter{Future Work}

As already said my goal is to allow real-time processing of the sound
coming from the mic line of the PC.\\
These are the next features needed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Make the application able to take the input stream from the mic
  line and to allow the user to change the audio settings adjusting them
  according to its needs and to the machine capabilities.
  \item Implement a noise reduction algorithm due to interferences
  from the PC.
  \item Add the ability to save a specific configuration of the effects 
  allowing the user to resume it when he wants.
  \item Create a kind of foot-switcher that handle the commands of the
  application, maybe using Arduino.
\end{itemize}
