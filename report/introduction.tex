\chapter{Introduction}

With the advent of the digital world the way in which the sound is
managed has been revolutioned increasing the versatility and the
capability of the audio effects.
Now a guitarist doesn't have to spend a lot of money, buying pedals, to
use the effects and find its own sound: there are on
the market a lot of pedals that are able to emulate (pretty well) the
most famous analog effects of the major manufacturers and that are more
powerful than their corresponding analog.


Digital
effects allow to experiment new processing techniques creating new
sounds that in the analog domain are impossible to obtain; also they
guarantees more safety because the musician must not have to deal with
cables and possible damages of the circuits.

With this project I try to create an application that is able to process
an audio stream with some DSP algorithm. It use the
\texttt{Java Sound API}\cite{javasound}, particularly the package
\texttt{javax.sound.sampled} to obtain the input and output lines from
the system.\\
It is equipped with a graphical interface developed using the \texttt{Swing}
library.

The ultimate aim of the project is to allow user to plug its guitar jack
in the mic input of the pc and to start playing modifying the sound in
real-time with the effects provided by the application. Now the
application can process an input stream given from an audio file stored
on the PC because the real-time functionality involve in many
difficulties, such as noise and latency, that due for time I have not
yet been able to overcome.
