\chapter{Conclusion}
This project gave me the possibility to enhance my knowledge of the
Object Oriented Programming paradigm by dealing with the development of
an exciting application.

The development of the project took me quite some time that maybe
slightly exceeded the limit of one hundred hours considering the time
to understand the Java Sound API, to study the DSP algorithms and to
make this report.
